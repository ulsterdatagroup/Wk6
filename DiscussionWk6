With Wk6 there is an issue working with sampledata.
See slide 5

Mine was here
C:\Users\*****yourWindowsUser****\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\bokeh\sampledata

Also with the download of the larger sampledata packages, this worked in AnacondaPrompt
bokeh sampledata

Then downloaded here
C:\Users\*****yourWindowsUser****\.bokeh\data

Cheers
